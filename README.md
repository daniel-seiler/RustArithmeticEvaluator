# Rust - Arithmetic Evaluator
## Task
Consider Haskell to implement other languages
  1. Represent the Haskell data type in Rust
  2. Implement the evaluator in Rust includeing simplifications (e.g. "0 * x" shall immediately yield 0).
  3. Draw a comparison between Haskell and Rust
  4. Summarize your findings in a short document.
